                    Abstract
                </h2> 
                <p>
                    We study the problem of functional retargeting: learning dexterous manipulation policies to track object states from human hand-object demonstrations. We focus on long-horizon, bimanual tasks with articulated objects, which is challenging due to large action space, spatiotemporal discontinuities, and embodiment gap between human and robot hands. 
                    We propose DexMachina, a novel curriculum-based algorithm: the key idea is to use virtual object controllers with decaying strength: an object is first driven automatically towards its target states, such that the policy can gradually learn to take over under motion and contact guidance. 
                    We release a simulation benchmark with a diverse set of tasks and dexterous hands, and show that DexMachina significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our algorithm and benchmark enable a functional comparison for hardware designs, and we present key findings informed by quantitative and qualitative results. 
                    With the recent surge in dexterous hand development, we hope this work will provide a useful platform for identifying desirable hardware capabilities and lower the barrier for contributing to future research.

                    Overview
                </h3>

                <p>
                    We propose DexMachina, a novel algorithm that achieves functional retargeting for a variety of hands and objects. 
                    At a high-level, we train an RL policy using a virtual object controller curriculum, guided by both a task reward and auxiliary rewards.

                <h3>Task and Auxiliary Rewards</h3>
                <p>
                    Given one demonstration, we first use its object states to define task reward. Next, we run a collision-aware kinematic retargeting procedure, which produces reference dexterous hand motions: we use them for motion imitation reward and residual wrist actions. We then approximate hand-object contact positions, which we use to define contact reward.

                    Virtual Object Controller Curriculum

                <p>
                    The reward terms and residual action learning can sometimes achieve short and simple tasks, but struggle on long-horizon clips with complex contacts, where the policy often experiences catastrophic early failures.
                    This motivates us to propose a novel curriculum approach, to let the policy explore different strategies in a less fragile setting.

                <p>
                    To evaluate dexmachina, we use a subset of ARCTIC data which includes 5 articulated objects and 7 clips consisting of diverse motion sequences and both long and short-horizon demonstrations. 
                    We curate assets for 6 open-source dexterous robot hand models, with varying sizes and kinematic designs.

                    DexMachina outperforms baseline methods across all tasks and hands
                </h3>

                <p>
                    We first evaluate on 4 hands. We compare dexmachina with direct replay of kinematic retargeting results, two baseline methods, and training with our proposed rewards but without curriculum. With rare exceptions, our method consistently achieves the best performance across all the hands and tasks, especially on long-horizon tasks with complex motion sequences.

                <p>
                    Without policy learning, kinematic retargeting can produce human-like hand motions, but when we play the retargeting results in simulation, they are not feasible for completing the task.

                 <p> 
                    For example, on the Notebook task, the XHand policy follows the human demonstrator to use the left hand to hold up the object and the right hand to close the cover,
                    But for the smaller, less-actuated Inspire Hand, the policy learns to use both hands to stabilize the object and close the cover, despite using the same human hand motion reference as Xhand

                    DexMachina enables a functional comparison between hardware designs
                </h3>
                 <p> 
                    With an effective functional retargeting algorithm, we can now perform a functional comparison between different dexterous hands. We focus on the 4 long-horizon tasks, and evaluate dexMachina on two additional hands. We compare the performance of all the hands and discuss key empirical findings. 
                    Overall, we see the larger, fully-actuated hands can achieve both higher final performance and better learning efficiency.
                    Interestingly, degrees of freedom is more important than hand sizes.
                    Schunk hand and Xhand, for example, have more actuated fingers, and perform much better than Inspire hand and ability hand which are similar in size to human hands

                    With the recent surge in dexterous hand development, we hope our work will provide a useful platform, that can help identify desirable hardware capabilities and lower the contribution barrier for future research.
